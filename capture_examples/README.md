These files represent the data I have captured over multiple versions of my software.
That's why some of these datasets will not work with the decoding software.
More recent captures are (much) more likely to work.

You can use these files to test out the decoding program by yourself.
(IMAGE_30.TXT will definitely be decoded properly)
