# Thermal Camera with image saving capability
Original program and 3D-printed case are from: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2799023
An explanation of what this code does and what to look out for can be found on the Thingiverse page.
I run my ESP8266 at 160MHz -> higher framerate (select in Arduino Board Options).

Sorry for the rather messy python code. It works.
I got very useful help from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52027382/how-do-i-convert-a-csv-file-16bit-high-color-to-image-in-python
